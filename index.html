        <p>The Existence of God

            I always keep in mind Occam’s Razor: "Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity.” In short, this says
            that the simplest explanation tends to be the right one. In other words, in layman’s terms, the explanation
            that is the least complicated will be the one that is probably the right one. We can certainly apply this
            when considering the existence of God. The only possible answers are either he does or he does not. Of
            course, we can say that we don’t know or can’t know, that doesn’t change the fact that God does or doesn’t
            exist. And I think it matters a lot whether God does or doesn’t exist, primarily for one reason.
            We all want purpose. We all want value. Or better said, we like to think that life has purpose and value.
            Let’s say that atheism is true, that there is no creator. Things just happened. As of now there is
            scientific explanation as to how things exist, that is to say how they came to be. Why there is matter and
            energy, where it came from, is unknown, but we can say that since there is no creator, either it has always
            been there or it came to be somehow. The first reason, that it has always been there, has been disproved by
            the big bang. There was beginning, and matter did not always exist. So, somehow it came to be. But it is
            unknown. But whatever the case may be, it exists, but without any guidance but impartial laws. That being
            the case, there is no rhyme or reason, there is no purpose or value, to anything that exists. It just is.
            Yet, how many would actually think that there is no meaning to anything? Wouldn’t that mean that our
            happiness is pointless? Our sufferings, wouldn’t it make it pointless to complain about them?
